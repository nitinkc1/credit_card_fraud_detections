# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project! This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Credit card fraud is a serious concern for both financial institutions and cardholders. Through this project, we aim to create an effective solution that can identify fraudulent activities and prevent unauthorized transactions, thereby protecting cardholders from potential financial losses.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a large number of credit card transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent ones. Each transaction record includes various features such as the transaction amount, timestamp, and anonymized features derived from the cardholder's data. The dataset is imbalanced, as genuine transactions significantly outnumber fraudulent ones, making fraud detection a challenging task.

## Model Development

To address the imbalanced nature of the dataset, we will explore various techniques such as:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, scaling, and handling missing values in the dataset.

- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and selecting relevant ones to improve model performance.

- **Resampling Techniques:** Using oversampling, undersampling, or a combination of both to balance the class distribution.

- **Model Selection:** Evaluating different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to identify the most suitable one.

- **Model Evaluation:** Employing metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) to assess the model's performance.
